    Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Culpa dolore a nisi eligendi suscipit repellat,

<p> Under UK consumer law, consumers may choose to have defective goods or goods which do not conform with the 
    contract sale either repaired or replaced free of charge. If a repair or replacement is not possible, would
    impose a disproportionate burden on the seller, or could not be performed in a reasonable time and without 
    significant inconvenience to the consumer, the consumer may choose either to have the price reduced or to 
    withdraw from the contract by returning the product in exchange for a full refund.  A consumer is also entitled
    to withdraw from the contract by returning the product in exchange for a full refund if the consumer rejects the
    goods within 30 days or if the product does not conform with the contract after one repair or replacement. 
    Any defect or non-conformity of goods with the contract which becomes apparent within 6 months of delivery are presumed
    to have existed at the time of delivery. After the expiry of this 6 month period, the burden to prove that the defect or
    non-conformity of goods with the contract existed on delivery generally shifts to the consumer.
